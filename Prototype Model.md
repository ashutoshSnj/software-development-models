# 2️⃣ Prototype Model

![Prototype Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashutoshSnj/software-development-models/main/Prototyping-model.png)

## 📌 Overview
The Prototype Model is used when the exact requirements of the customer are not known. Instead of freezing the requirements early, a prototype is developed to understand what the client actually wants.

This prototype is a working version with limited features — it helps both the developer and client to understand the software behavior.

## 🔁 Phases in Detail

1. **Initial Requirements Identification**  
   Developers gather basic and unclear requirements. These are not fixed — just enough to start building a prototype.

2. **Develop Prototype**  
   A quick version of the software is created. It may not include all functionality, but gives a feel of the real system.

3. **User Evaluation and Feedback**  
   The client uses the prototype and gives feedback. This is the most crucial part of this model.

4. **Refinement of Prototype**  
   Based on feedback, changes are made and the prototype is improved or rebuilt.

5. **Final System Development**  
   Once requirements are clear and the prototype is accepted, the real system is developed and deployed.

## ✅ Advantages
- Improves communication between client and developer.
- Reduces chances of requirement misunderstandings.
- User actively involved in early phases.

## ❌ Disadvantages
- Frequent changes can increase cost.
- Prototype might be misunderstood as the final system.
- Extra effort required to build prototypes.

## 💡 Real-Life Analogy
Like trying on clothes in a store before buying — you get a feel for the product before committing to the final one.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Insight
Perfect when client isn’t clear about requirements. You’ll save time by avoiding rework later.
