# 2️⃣ Prototype Model

![Prototype Model](https://github.com/ashutoshSnj/SDL-img/blob/main/Prototyping-model.png)

## 📌 Overview
The Prototype Model focuses on building a **working model of the software (prototype)** early in the development process. It is highly useful when requirements are not clear. The prototype helps both client and developer understand and refine the system before the final version is built.

## 🧱 When to Use
- Client is unsure about exact requirements
- User interfaces are important (UI/UX-heavy systems)
- High-risk projects where client feedback is essential

## 🔁 Phases Explained in Detail

### 1. Initial Requirement Gathering
- Focus on gathering high-level or basic requirements.
- Detailed specs are not necessary at this stage.

### 2. Quick Design & Prototype Development
- Rapidly develop a basic version of the software (UI or partial logic).
- Emphasis on speed, not quality or completeness.

### 3. Client Evaluation
- Client uses the prototype, tests workflow, suggests changes.
- Interaction is iterative — may go through several feedback loops.

### 4. Refinement
- Developers update prototype based on feedback.
- Process continues until client approves the features and UI.

### 5. Final System Development
- Once prototype is finalized, full development begins.
- Clear and confirmed requirements are implemented in production version.

### 6. System Testing and Delivery
- Final system is thoroughly tested and delivered.
- Prototype is usually discarded after final build.

## ✅ Pros
- Helps clarify vague or unknown requirements.
- High customer satisfaction due to continuous involvement.
- Errors and misunderstandings are detected early.

## ❌ Cons
- Time-consuming if client keeps changing ideas.
- May increase budget due to multiple iterations.
- Developers may reuse bad code from prototype (technical debt).

## 👟 Real-Life Analogy
Like test-driving a car before buying. You may test different models (prototypes) until you finalize your choice.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Insight
Great model for UI-heavy apps or startup MVPs. But avoid reusing prototype code blindly — rewrite properly.
