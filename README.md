# 🌀 Spiral Model

## 📌 Overview
The Spiral Model is a **risk-driven software development model** that combines elements of both **design and prototyping** in stages. It's best suited for **large, complex, and high-risk projects**.

Unlike the waterfall model, the Spiral Model allows for incremental releases and continuous refinement through repeated cycles (or spirals).

## 🔁 Key Features
- Emphasizes **risk analysis**
- Involves **iterative development**
- Combines **design and prototyping**
- Suitable for **complex projects with changing requirements**

## 🔍 Phases in Each Spiral
1. **Planning** – Requirements gathering and analysis.
2. **Risk Analysis** – Identify and evaluate risks.
3. **Engineering** – Actual development and testing.
4. **Evaluation** – Customer feedback and planning for next spiral.

## ✅ Advantages
- Strong risk management
- Good for large projects
- Can incorporate changes easily

## ❌ Disadvantages
- Not suitable for small projects
- Risk assessment expertise required
- Can be costly and time-consuming

## 🧠 Use Case
- Complex ERP systems  
- Banking and defense applications where failure is costly
