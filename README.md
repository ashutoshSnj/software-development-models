## 📌 Overview
The Spiral Model is a risk-driven software development process model that combines elements of both design and prototyping in stages. It is intended for large, complex, and high-risk projects.

## 🔄 Phases of Each Spiral Loop
1️⃣ **Planning** – Identify objectives, alternatives, and constraints.  
2️⃣ **Risk Analysis** – Identify and resolve project risks.  
3️⃣ **Engineering** – Develop and verify the next-level product.  
4️⃣ **Evaluation** – Assess the previous cycle and plan the next.

## ✅ Best Suited For
- Large, high-risk projects.
- Projects with uncertain requirements.
- Projects requiring regular risk assessments and client feedback.

## ❌ Drawbacks
- Can be expensive due to repeated phases.
- Requires expertise in risk analysis.

## 💡 Real-Life Analogy
Like developing a rocket – every step must be tested and verified before moving forward.
