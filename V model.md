# ✅ V-Model (Validation and Verification Model)

## 📌 Overview
The V-Model is an **extension of the Waterfall model** where each development stage is associated with a testing phase. It's known as the **Validation and Verification** model because every coding phase is verified and validated before proceeding.

## 📈 Key Features
- Sequential like Waterfall
- Each phase has a corresponding test phase
- Emphasis on early test planning

## 🔍 V-Shape Workflow
- **Left Side (Development)**: Requirements → Design → Coding
- **Right Side (Testing)**: Unit Test → Integration Test → System Test → Acceptance Test

## ✅ Advantages
- Simple and easy to manage
- Errors detected early
- Better test planning

## ❌ Disadvantages
- Not suitable for changing requirements
- No working software until the end

## 🧠 Use Case
- Projects with clearly defined requirements  
- Medical devices, air traffic control systems, and embedded systems

## 📊 Summary Table

| Feature | V-Model |
|--------|---------|
| Sequential | ✅ |
| Test Planning | ✅ Early |
| Flexibility | ❌ |
| Complexity Handling | ❌ Medium |
| Cost | ✅ Predictable |
