# 1️⃣ Waterfall Model

![Waterfall Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashutoshSnj/software-development-models/main/sdlc_waterfall_model.jpg)

## 📌 Overview
The Waterfall Model is a **sequential software development model** where progress flows downwards — like a waterfall — through multiple phases. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins. It’s ideal when the project scope and requirements are well-defined and fixed.

## 🧱 Suitable For
- Projects with stable requirements
- Systems where documentation and regulation is critical
- Small to medium size projects with fixed budget and deadline

## 🔁 Phases in Detail

### 1. Requirements Gathering & Analysis
- Meet with client/stakeholders to gather all system expectations.
- Freeze the scope upfront; any change later is costly.
- Example: An ATM software with clear rules and no frequent change.

### 2. System Design
- Create high-level and low-level design.
- Choose tech stack, database schema, architecture, modules.

### 3. Implementation
- Code is written based on design docs.
- Developers don’t interact with the client at this point.

### 4. Integration and Testing
- All components are integrated.
- Testing types: Unit, System, Integration, Acceptance.

### 5. Deployment
- Deployed in production or client environment.
- Training and documentation is delivered.

### 6. Maintenance
- Fix post-release bugs.
- Make minor improvements (but no big changes unless full cycle restarts).

## ✅ Advantages
- Simple to understand and manage
- Document-driven
- Ideal for short and well-planned projects

## ❌ Disadvantages
- No feedback loop once development starts
- Testing is late in the cycle
- Changes are difficult and expensive

## 💡 Real-World Analogy
Like building a house with a blueprint. Once built, it’s hard to modify foundation or walls.
