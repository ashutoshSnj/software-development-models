# 1️⃣ Waterfall Model

## 📌 Overview
The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest approaches to software development. It is a **linear and sequential model** where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.

This model works best when all requirements are known upfront and are unlikely to change.

## 🔁 Phases in Detail

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis**  
   All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in detail. These become the foundation of the next phases.

2. **System Design**  
   Based on the requirements, system architecture and design decisions are made, including technologies, data models, etc.

3. **Implementation**  
   Developers write the code as per the design. Usually, the code is written in modules and integrated step-by-step.

4. **Integration and Testing**  
   Once the system is developed, it's thoroughly tested to verify that it meets the requirements. Unit, integration, and system testing are done.

5. **Deployment**  
   The product is released into the production environment. It becomes available for actual use.

6. **Maintenance**  
   This includes handling updates, bug fixes, and enhancements after delivery.

## ✅ Advantages
- Simple to use and easy to understand.
- Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.
- Ideal for smaller projects with clear and fixed requirements.

## ❌ Disadvantages
- Not suitable for complex or object-oriented projects.
- Difficult to go back to any stage once it's completed.
- Late discovery of bugs during testing phase.
- Client feedback is received very late.

## 💡 Real-Life Analogy
Like constructing a building: once the foundation is laid and floors are constructed, changing anything becomes difficult and costly.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Insight
As a developer, this model feels very rigid. You can’t move ahead until the previous step is complete. Also, any misunderstanding in requirements is usually discovered very late — making changes costly.
