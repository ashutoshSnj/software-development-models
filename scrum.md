# ⚡ Agile Scrum Model

## 📌 Overview
Agile Scrum is a **lightweight framework** for managing complex software projects. It emphasizes **iterative development**, **collaboration**, and **flexibility**.

Scrum breaks the work into small, manageable **sprints** and includes roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.

## 💡 Key Principles
- Customer collaboration over contracts
- Working software over documentation
- Individuals and interactions over processes
- Responding to change over following a plan
